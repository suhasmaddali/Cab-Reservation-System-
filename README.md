## Challenges
* One of the __challenges__ with the cab reservation system is that an user is not able to get an accurate estimated time it takes for the driver to pickup in their current location. 
* Furthermore, user interface (UI) for cab reservation is often complex which makes the user enter a lot of details before even booking a ride initially.
* As a result, this slows down the process overall of picking an __user__ respectively. 
 
 ## Solution 
* We considered this project and thought of combating these challenges with the aid of __MySQL__ and __Flask__. 
* We've built an interactive UI that takes minimal information about the user along with providing the most accurate estimate of the wait time. 
* As an end product, we get an UI that is quite easy for the user to understand and book a ride. 
* In addition to this, machine learning is used to get the accurate estimates of the time it takes for the driver to arrive on time.
