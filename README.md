## ðŸ‘‰ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location.

4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository.

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.
